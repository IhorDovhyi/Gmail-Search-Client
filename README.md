2) once authenticated, will allow the user to check email in the GMail mailbox:
• by default first 10 emails should be uploaded. Clicking on "next page" of the grid (see below), should load more emails. 
• add an option to filter emails by "starred", "not read", ''archived"
3) results should shown in the data grid that has the following columns: 
• emails titles
• from
• date (when received) 
• "View" button. should trigger a popup with email content show in html editor (example: CK Editor). 
◦ label (starred, not read, archived) Additional Requirements:
